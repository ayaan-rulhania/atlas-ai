The emission from an AGN is powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc. Gas in the disc falling towards the black hole heats up and releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The radiant energy of quasars is enormous; the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times greater than that of a galaxy such as the Milky Way. Quasars are usually categorized as a subclass of the more general category of AGN. The redshifts of quasars are of cosmological origin.",

Owing to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons and mesons, or in quark\u2013gluon plasmas. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons.",

      "content": "A quark (/ \u02c8kw\u0254\u02d0rk, \u02c8kw\u0251\u02d0rk / \u24d8) is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. [1] All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons. Owing to a phenomenon known as color confinement ...",

Sample baryons, including quark content and properties, are given in Table. Interestingly, the delta plus (\u0394 +) baryon is formed from the same three quarks as the proton, but the total spin of the particle is 3/2 rather than 1/2. Similarly, the mass of ...",
