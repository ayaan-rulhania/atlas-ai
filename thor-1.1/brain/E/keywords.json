An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity, the more an atom or a substituent group attracts electrons. Electronegativity serves as a simple way to quantitatively estimate the bond energy, and the sign and magnitude of a bond's chemical polarity, which characterizes a bond along the continuous scale from covalent to ionic bonding. The loosely defined term electropositivity is the opposite of electronegativity: it characterizes an element's tendency to donate valence electrons.",

Epicurus was an atomist and materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to religious skepticism and a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism, and its main opponent later became Stoicism. It is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal. However, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from hedonism as colloquially understood.",

      "content": "A Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies that players act out, with the property that no player benefits from changing their strategy. Intuitively, this means that if any given player were told the strategies of all their opponents, they still would choose to retain their original strategy. For example, in the game of trying to guess 2/3 of the average guesses, the unique Nash equilibrium is ...",

      "content": "Nash Equilibrium is a concept in game theory where no player can benefit from changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged. In this state, each player's decision is optimal given the decisions of others, creating a situation of mutual best responses. This equilibrium is crucial for understanding how firms interact in oligopolistic markets, as it helps to predict ...",
