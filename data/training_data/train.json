    "input": "What is artificial intelligence?",
    "output": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems can be trained on large amounts of data to recognize patterns and make decisions.",
    "task": "text_generation"
  },
  {
    "input": "Explain machine learning",
    "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that computers use to perform specific tasks without using explicit instructions. Instead, these systems are trained on data to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions.",
    "task": "text_generation"
  },
  {
    "input": "What are neural networks?",
    "output": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that can learn from data through a process called training. Each connection has a weight that adjusts during learning.",
    "task": "text_generation"
  },
  {
    "input": "Describe the process of photosynthesis",
    "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process occurs in chloroplasts and involves carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce oxygen and glucose as byproducts.",
    "task": "text_generation"
  },
  {
    "input": "What is quantum computing?",
    "output": "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Unlike classical computers that use bits, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.",
    "task": "text_generation"
  },
  {
    "input": "Explain the concept of recursion",
    "output": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Each recursive call breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems until reaching a base case that can be solved directly. This approach is commonly used for problems that have a recursive structure.",
    "task": "text_generation"
  },
  {
    "input": "What is blockchain technology?",
    "output": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a timestamp, transaction data, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, making it resistant to modification.",
    "task": "text_generation"
  },
  {
    "input": "Describe how evolution works",
    "output": "Evolution is the process by which species change over time through natural selection. Organisms with traits that better adapt them to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those advantageous traits to their offspring. Over many generations, this leads to significant changes in populations.",
